For this question, you need to complete the implementations of both the subject and the single observer for the observer pattern.
In this example, the subject is a student that can have 1 event happen that we want to track, which is the student
attending class, which increases the attendance record by one.

Make sure that you pay close attention to the contracts for each method. Pay especially close attention to the format
of the Observer's notify method, as you'll need to make sure that the method prints the correct information after the
event occurs so that the autograder can correctly determine if your implementation is correct.
