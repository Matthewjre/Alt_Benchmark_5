For Question One, you need to implement the Factory pattern using specifically an Interface.

There are 4 provided files. Three of them are Models files that don't need any kind of modification, but it might help
to familiarize yourself with them. You also have a file called Q1Driver that provides a main method for you to run to help
confirm that your implementation of the Factory pattern is correct.

TODO: Create the IShapeFactory interface file and the two implementations of IShapeFactory called EquTriangleFactory and SquareFactory.

MAKE SURE THAT YOU PUT THESE FACTORIES IN THE src/QuestionOne/Factories package

Once you implement the factories, uncomment out the code in the driver file and run it. You should be able to tell
that your implementation of the Factory pattern works based on what we know about how the factory pattern works.
