For this benchmark, you'll be demonstrating your understanding of two of the design patterns we've discussed in class, plus
your ability to learn a whole new patten based entirely on documentation that you find online and 0 instruction from me.

The patterns in question are

Question 1: The Factory Pattern
Question 2: The Observer Pattern
Question 3: The Singleton Pattern

Each question takes place in its own package, and each package has its own README with more specific instruction for
what you need to do to answer that question. Currently, the project is in a runnable state, even if some methods are
unimplemented or contain "illogical / filler implementations". This means if you turn in something that doesn't compile,
you're turning in something that is in a worse state than the starter code was in, so 0 points will be given.

When you complete the benchmark, you'll need to submit the following files to gradescope. ONLY submit these files, DO NOT
submit the entire project. If you do, you'll get 0 points for the benchmark.

1. src/QuestionOne/Factories/IShapeFactory.java
2. src/QuestionOne/Factories/EquTriangleFactory.java
3. src/QuestionOne/Factories/SquareFactory.java
4. src/QuestionTwo/Subject/Student.java
5. src/QuestionTwo/Observers/AttendanceObserver.java
6. src/QuestionThree/MyOnlyObject.java

If you have any questions, please ask. Don't just sit there confused. If you have no idea what's going on, I can't really help
but if you're running into a relatively small compile error, I can help you with that. Once you submit, you should see
what you've made on Gradescope. If you see a message saying the autograder failed to execute, that's a problem and needs
to be fixed before time is called. I will NOT accept any submissions 3 minutes past the scheduled end time of class.
